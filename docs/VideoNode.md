# ðŸ¤“ Understanding the VideoNode concept

A **VideoNode**, in Claptime jargon, is an abstract type that embraces films, series and series episodes.
We can see this as a tree structure: a video is a leaf, and can either be a film or a series episode depending if it has a parent node or not. This might sounds complicated at first, but also makes it easier because both concepts are stored and can be queried in the same way.

At any time, the user can also delete the video node which immediately deletes it from our database.
